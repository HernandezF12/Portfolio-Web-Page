          <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
          <div>
            <p>After graduating from high school, I joined the United States Navy in search of personal and professional
                development;working with a variety of people ranging between beginners and experienced professionals.</p>
            <p>While I did love my job working with weaponry, I felt the need to transition into a new field of work.
                Into an ever progressive field that I have a strong passion for.</p>
            <p> With the help from Thinkful, I was able to begin my transition into becoming a software engineer
                and because of this I couldn't be  more delighted to see what the future holds. </p>
            <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please feel free to reach out! I am thrilled to work with
            other developers to create amazing software and grow together.</p>
